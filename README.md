This is a little fun mini-version of one of the most famous games in History 'Mario'. The purpose was to create a unique mini-version of the game for myself.

It is developed in Python (using the Pygame module).

You can fork the repo and run the game by running:

python3 World.py (assuming you cd into the directory)

Game not completed, more to come.
